# BabyBlockChain
BlockChain Demo in Golang

- Original Blog and Github Repo
    - https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/
    - https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go
  
- This Repo has the same code as the Jeiwan's amazing project.
- All basic features of blockchain and bitcoin can be found in this demo, including:
  - Database
  - Network and Nodes
  - Wallets and Digital Signature
  - Transaction and Proof-of-Work
  - Mining and Reward  
  - Blocks and BlockChain

- Since the original repo has some tricky bugs, you can directly clone this repo.
  - but building a real blockchain demo from nothing is quite interesting. 
  - and I believe any questions you have can be answered by those blogs.
